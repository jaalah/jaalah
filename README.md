### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jaalah (Jay-luh), and I currently work in Compute on the Cloud Manager team. Frontend is my passion, especially when it comes to Design Systems. I'm all about improving Developer Experience (DX) and making products accessible to everyone. The mix of code and design really interests me! For me, it's not just about writing code; it's about creating meaningful experiences through design and functionality.
